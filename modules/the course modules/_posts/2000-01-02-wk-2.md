## Week 2: Robin Alexander - Taking a dialogic stance

'Dialogic teaching harnesses the power of talk to engage interest, stimulate thinking, advance understanding, expand ideas, and build and evaluate arguments, empowering students for lifelong learning and democratic engagement.' 
(Alexander, R.J. (2020) A Dialogic Teaching Companion, Routledge, p.1) 

This week we look at the ways in which attending to classroom ethos can support educators and learners to take a dialogic stance. We ask, how does subscribing to core dialogic principles enable educators to develop a range of repertoires to facilitate teaching and learning?

## Do

* Thinking about your classroom, evaluate how far it reflects Alexander’s dialogic principles. The [Week 2 reflective journal template](https://mbrugha.github.io/fundamentals-of-ed-dialogue/img/Wk2_journal.docx) has some helpful prompts to support you in this activity.
* In your Week 2 journal, write a reflective account of your classroom practice in relation to either Alexander’s principles and/or his dialogic repertoires. There’s a space for you to do this at the end of the template. _Reminder: the weekly accounts you are asked to write in your reflective journals do not need to be submitted. Rather, they are meant to help you record your thoughts and should be drawn on when writing your final learning product. Your final learning product is the only piece of writing you are asked to officially submit for this course._
