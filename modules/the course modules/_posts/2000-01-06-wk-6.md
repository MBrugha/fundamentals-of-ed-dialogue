## Week 6: Paulo Freire and Ramón Flecha - Transformative, holistic and decolonial approaches to dialogue

'There's no such thing as neutral education. Education either functions as an instrument to bring about conformity or freedom.'
_― Paulo Freire, [Pedagogy of the Oppressed](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/915602)_

In this final week of the course, we look at Paulo’s Freire’s conceptualisation of dialogic pedagogy which precedes much of the work that we have looked at so far, and in many ways arises from a very different starting point. We then look at how Freire’s ideas have been picked up by Ramón Flecha and operationalised in schools worldwide. This is only one example of Freirian pedagogy in action, Freire has been a hugely influential thinker and his work is very important to the global movement to decolonise education. We build on one of the core questions from last week: Is dialogue a ‘western’ idea? Freire’s work is one way of answering this question, as he proposes a radical approach to dialogic pedagogy as a form of resistance to the ongoing impact of colonialism and slavery. The ‘Successful Educational Actions for All’ project offers an example of this approach to dialogic pedagogy, through targeted actions such as ‘Interactive Groups’ and ‘Dialogic Literary Gatherings’. We also briefly refer to Confucian and Islamic approaches to educational dialogue and invite you to continue your learning journey through further MOOCs in our series.

* As we outlined in the video for this week, this course is the first in a three-part series. Course 2 ‘Conducting a Reflective Inquiry’ will be launched in the autumn (2022). If you are interested in joining the Course 2 trial, please sign up via this link: [https://forms.gle/RPtaZdpFsJqKhy5d6](https://forms.gle/RPtaZdpFsJqKhy5d6). Course 3 ‘Supporting your Colleagues through Facilitation’ is for individuals who are interested in taking their knowledge of educational dialogue a step further and supporting their colleagues to use T-SEDA to improve their dialogic practices.
* A range of other sites might also be of interest as you continue to develop your understanding of educational dialogue: [CEDiR](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/cedir/), [Edudialogue.org](https://www.edudialogue.org/), and [Camtree](https://camtree.org/) as well as the ones cited throughout the last six weeks.

## Do
Thinking about your context, are there individual or groups of learners who are affected by the ongoing impacts of colonialism and slavery? In what ways have they been impacted? What power structures do you as an educator operate in? How do they affect you? How do they affect your learners? 

Within your practice is there anything you can do to ‘decolonise’ education? If you can think of some ideas and wish to work towards ‘decolonising education’, then think about some practical steps you can take. Write these in your [reflective learning journal for Week 6](https://mbrugha.github.io/fundamentals-of-ed-dialogue/img/Wk6_journal.docx). You may have the opportunity to try out your ideas, if you do, write an account of what they are and what happens when you trial them.

Join us for a close of course virtual event! We will be hosting two to account for different timezones: Thursday, April 7th at 19:00 British time (GMT+1) and Saturday, April 9th at 15:00 British time (GMT+1). You are of course welcome to attend both and you do not need to have completed the week's materials or your Reflective Report to join.

Complete your Reflective Report and submit it to Meaghan at meb78@cam.ac.uk by Sunday, April 24th. Please let us know if you are unable to meet this deadline. We have developed a tentative template for your Reflective Report [here](https://mbrugha.github.io/fundamentals-of-ed-dialogue/img/Reflective_Report_template.docx), but we encourage you to adapt this and make it your own.

## Discuss
In the [Week 6 channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/fundamentals-mooc/week-6-paulo-freire-ramon-flecha-transformative-holistic-and-decolonial-approaches-to-dialogue/#post-321), please post a response to at least one of these questions.
* Thinking about the Paulo Freire quote: “There's no such thing as neutral education. Education either functions as an instrument to bring about conformity or freedom”, do you agree? Please explain.
* Are you educating learners for conformity or freedom? Does dialogue lead to freedom? If so, how?
* Thinking again about intercultural dialogue, are conformity and freedom necessarily oppositional to each other? Is freedom a neutral term, or has ‘freedom’ also been used to maintain cultural dominance by declaring other cultures less free?

Now, read through others’ responses to these questions and reply with your ideas to at least one person.
