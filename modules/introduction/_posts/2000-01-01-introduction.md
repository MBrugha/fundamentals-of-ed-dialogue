## Welcome to the course!

This course is 6 weeks in length, and offers a new module and focus area each week:
* Week 1: An introduction to educational dialogue
* Week 2: Robin Alexander - Taking a dialogic stance
* Week 3: Neil Mercer - Interthinking through exploratory talk
* Week 4: Sara Hennessy - Visualising classroom dialogue through dialogic moves
* Week 5: Rupert Wegerif - Opening up a dialogic space for reflection and agency
* Week 6: Paulo Freire and Ram√≥n Flecha - Transformative, holistic and decolonial approaches to dialogue

Participants can expect to spend between 2 to 3 hours per week on course readings, activities and discussions. Participants will keep a reflective learning journal throughout the course. Course tasks and activities will support you in engaging in this reflective practice. While participants are able to complete the weekly tasks whenever is convenient for their schedules, it is expected that all tasks for the week will be completed by the Sunday night GMT each week.

To receive a Certificate of Completion, participants will have to complete all weekly tasks and submit a quality reflective journal of approximately 2000 words.
