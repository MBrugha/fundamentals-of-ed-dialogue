## About the course

This course is designed for educators who are interested in learning about the foundational theories behind educational dialogue. It is appropriate for educators who are new to educational dialogue as well as for those who wish to refresh their knowledge. The course will facilitate and support educators to explore and evaluate different theories and perspectives on educational dialogue in order to develop their thinking about their own classroom practices.

This course is part of a suite of courses, which are based around some of the (intersecting) main research areas of the [CEDiR](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/cedir/) (Cambridge Educational Dialogue Research) group. CEDiR is a research group within the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge that draws together a range of Faculty colleagues who are interested in educational dialogue and aim to create and share high quality research. You can subscribe to the CEDiR newsletter at the bottom of the [CEDiR webpage](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/cedir/).

We recommend completing this course prior to engaging in our other Educational Dialogue courses: 
* Course 2: Conducting a Reflective Inquiry
* Course 3: Supporting your Colleagues through Facilitation
